Once done, we then assumed the great challenge to disseminate our culture through the execution of this blend of dances, music and culture.</p>\n          <p>In 1989, the Espejo sisters Doris and Jeanine, who where then 6 and 4 years old, began to learn and practice the Peruvian dances under the direction of their dance teacher and choreographer Rosagna Sanchez during the first 8 years. Now, years later, Jeanine continues to learn and perform the native dances with enthusiasm and enjoyment. In 1995, Raices Peruanas grew stronger when Margott Hinostroza, Maria Luisa Alvarado, Julie Shimabuco, Maria Lilet Burmester, Walter Almora, Edwin Delgado, Jose Elorrieta, and Henry Aquije, became members and the pioneers of this dance group.</p>\n          <p>It was through the effort of the Espejo family then, that the group Raíces Peruanas was established in Southern California, leaving audiences at awe for the beauty and professionalism they portray at each of this group’s performances, uniting people and hearts in this multicultural land.</p>\n          <p>Doris and Jeanine were the first children to participate in this group, and later in 1996, at age 4, their younger sister April joined them. The three sisters are all U.S. born of Peruvian parents. Currently other young people of the Peruvian community in Los Angeles are also part of the group, promoting thus the participation of youngsters in art and culture.</p>\n          <h1 className='historyTitleEsp'>Raíces Peruanas de Los Angeles - Historia</h1>\n          <p>Era el amor a la tierra que nos vio nacer y a los sentimientos de inquietud que llenaba nuestros corazones cuando dejamos nuestra querida patria para venir a este país de grandes oportunidades, que nos motivó a juntar nuestra música, canciones, bailes tradicionales, trajes típicos, y el folclor de nuestro amado Perú. Entonces fue ahí que asumimos el gran reto de difundir nuestra cultura a través de las danzas y música.</p>\n          <p>En 1989, las hermanitas Doris y Jeanine Espejo, que en ese tiempo tenían 6 y 4 añitos, empezaron a aprender y a practicar los bailes tradicionales peruanos bajo la dirección de su profesora de baile y coreógrafa Rosagna Sanchez durante los primeros 8 años. Ahora, muchos años después, Jeanine continúa aprendiendo y actuando estos bailes nativos con mucho gozo y entusiasmo. En 1995, esta institución cultural se fortaleció cuando Margott Hinostroza, Maria Luisa Alvarado, Julie Shimabuco, Maria Lilet Burmester, Walter Almora, Edwin Delgado, Jose Elorieta, y Henry Aquije se hicieron integrantes del grupo convirtiéndose así en los pioneros de Raíces Peruanas.</p>\n          <p>Fue a través del esfuerzo de la familia Espejo que el grupo Raíces Peruanas fue establecido en el sur de California dejando a la audiencia pasmados por la belleza y profesionalismo al desempeñar cada una de sus actuaciones, uniendo a la gente y a corazones de este país multicultural.</p>\n          <p>Doris y Jeanine fueron las primeras niñas en participar en este grupo, y después en 1996, a los 4 años de edad, su hermana menor April se unió al grupo. Las tres hermanas son nacidas en EE.UU. de padres peruanos.
